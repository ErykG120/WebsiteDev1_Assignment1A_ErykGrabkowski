            <p>A lot of snow...</p>
            <p><em>An Analysis of Storm Emma and the cold spell which struck Ireland between the 28th of February and the 4th of March 2018. One of the most significant snowfall events of recent years affected Ireland in late February and early March. Weather from the 27th February to 4th of March saw temperatures plummet with widespread snowfall across the country. Temperatures struggled to rise above freezing as bitterly cold easterly winds swept in over the country causing widespread disruptions to roads, rail and air travel, with work and school closures.This report describes what a Sudden Stratospheric Warming is and how on the 12th of February 2018, a Sudden Stratospheric Warming influenced the synoptic weather patterns in the Northern Hemisphere a few weeks later, which led directly to the cold spell in Ireland. It gives a detailed account of the cold spell, dubbed the ‘Beast from the East’, and storm Emma’s development and path towards Ireland. It also provides an account of the warnings and advisories issued by Met Éireann and the impacts the cold spell had on the country.</em></p>

            <p>A great time abroad.</p>
            <p><em>On October 20th 2018, 12 students accompanied by their teachers Ms. Walsh and Ms. Conway travelled to Mainz in Germany on a school exchange with Willigs Boys Grammar School. They flew to Frankfurt Airport and were collected by host families and spent the weekend with them. They visited the famous St. Stephan Church, climbed the tower and saw the Marc Chagall stained glass windows. They were guests of the mayor in the Rheinhalle, they did a day trip to downtown Frankfurt for shopping, visited a castle in the Rhine Valley, St. Martin’s Cathedral, the Experiment Science Museum, Opel Arena, Mainz 05 Football Club and the Gutenberg Museum. They experienced German culture and put their language skills to the test! They had an overall fantastic experience and some hope to go back again next year.</em></p>
